# IPL-Case-Study-SQL-Project

In this project, we will analyze IPL cricket data to uncover insights into team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes.
🏏 We will use SQL to extract, transform, and analyze data from match-level and ball-by-ball datasets.
🏏 The analysis will provide insights into key areas such as the most successful players, team strategies, and factors influencing match results.
🏏 We will explore relationships between variables such as batting performance, bowling effectiveness, and match-winning strategies to gain a deeper understanding of the game.
