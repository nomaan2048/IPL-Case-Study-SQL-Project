# IPL-Case-Study-SQL-Project

In this project, we will analyze IPL cricket data to uncover insights into team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes.

🏏 We will use SQL to extract, transform, and analyze data from match-level and ball-by-ball datasets.

🏏 The analysis will provide insights into key areas such as the most successful players, team strategies, and factors influencing match results.

🏏 We will explore relationships between variables such as batting performance, bowling effectiveness, and match-winning strategies to gain a deeper understanding of the game.

# DATA:

  Contains match-level data, including:
  - Match ID, season, city, and date of the match.
  - Teams involved (team1 and team2), toss winner, and toss decision.
  - Match result details like winner, victory margin (runs/wickets), and whether Duckworth-Lewis method was applied.
  - Player of the Match, venue, and umpire information.

- 'deliveries.csv':  
  Provides ball-by-ball details for each match, including:
  - Match ID, inning number, batting and bowling teams.
  - Over and ball numbers, batsman, non-striker, and bowler names.
  - Runs scored (batsman runs, extras, total runs) and dismissal details (player dismissed, dismissal kind, fielder).
